Developer recruitment test
==========================

We ask you a class that can takes a version number as a string and can get some info from it.
We only need a part of the specification requirement (see comment in files for the url) so check the test file to see what we need for this exercise.


Rules
-----

* Use PHP 7.1
* Don't use regexp (then do it with regexp as a bonus)
* Don't modify test and interface file
* The specifications are provided only for info
* The test is the real constraint to consider the class works or not

Run test
--------

~~~shell
$ make
$ make test
~~~
